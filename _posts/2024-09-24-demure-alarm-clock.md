### A Demure Alarm Clock

Do you ever find your current alarm jarring, leaving you stressed from the very start of the day? When your alarm starts ringing at 7 AM, do you want a gentle nudge to start your morning, or do you want the usual loud blare that disturbs your peaceful slumber?

If you're looking for a calm and soothing way to wake up, I created *Demure Wakeup*—a mindful alarm clock app that helps you ease into your day. The curated calming sounds and serene visuals are handpicked to inspire peace and positivity. It’s a perfect way to start each morning with balance and tranquility.

Simply select the time of day, the days of the week, and the perfect tone for your alarm.
