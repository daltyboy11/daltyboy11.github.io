title: This is a test
---

It's the middle of the day and I'm trying to solve a hard problem at work. I'm on
to something. I think I have the solution but it falls short. Now I'm stuck.
The moment of discomfort arrives. A moment in which I have to think hard and
_really_ use my brain. But I don't. I can't. Because the discomfort of thought is
too much. In fact, it's unbearable. Instead I reach for my phone almost
unconsciously. Suddenly it's in my hands, screen unlocked, with Instagram
loading... How did I get here? I don't event remember. The feed loads and I breath
a sigh of relief as I scroll and every photo floods my brain with a shot of dopamine.
It feels good. I see nothing but chiseled bodies, picturesque landscapes, and food.
No, not food, but art. It's incredbile. How could that not make me feel good? Sure,
coming up with a solution for that problem at work would be rewarding and feel good
too, but it would take so much effort! Besides, thinking is hard. Why not just skip
the hard part?
