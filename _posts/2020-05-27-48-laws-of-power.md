title: Thoughts on The 48 Laws of Power
---

The [48 Laws of Power](https://amzn.to/3etuZzi) by Robert Greene in essence is a modernized and expanded
version of Machiavelli's _The Prince_. My interest in it stemmed from the
potential usefulness and application these laws could have in my life.

Although several of the laws supply useful lessons for the ambitious,
hardworking, and honest individual, the majority of them advocate a level deceit
and cunning far beyond what most people would comfortably put into practice.
This is fine, of course, if you operate in the upper echelons of power as a
military general, politician, or business magnate. For the rest of us without
vast amounts of wealth and influence already, advice like _use selective honesty
and generosity to disarm your victim_ (Law 12), _crush your enemy totally_ (Law
15), and _keep others suspended in terror_ (Law 17), are impractical.

It's not surprising that most laws involve violence, deceit, and cunning, as the
lessons are drawn from the histories of kings, emperors, military generals, and
con men. The book was a pleasant read but wasn't very useful beyond
entertainment. Despite this, there were several laws I found interesting and
practical:

- Never outshine the master (law 1)
- Guard your reputation with your life (Law 5)
- Avoid the unhappy and the unlucky (Law 10)
- Concentrate your forces (Law 23)
- Despise the free lunch (Law 40)
