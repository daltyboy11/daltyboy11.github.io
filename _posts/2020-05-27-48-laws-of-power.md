title: Thoughts on The 48 Laws of Power
---

I just finished reading _The 48 Laws of Power_ by Robert Greene. It's essentially
a modernized and expanded version of Machiavelli's _The Prince_. I wanted to
read it because I thought it's laws might be useful and applicable in my own
life, but this wasn't the case.

While several of the laws supply useful lessons for the ambitious,
hardworking, and honest individual, the vast majority of them advocate a level
of deceit and cunning far beyond what most are comfortable or capable of.
This is fine, of course, if you are operating in the upper echelons of power as
a military general, politician, business magnate, or the like. But if you don't
already have vast amounts of wealth or influence advice like "use selective
honesty and generosity to disarm your victim" (Law 12), "crush you enemy
totally" (Law 15), and "keep others supsended in terror" (Law 17) isn't exactly practical.

It's not suprising that a lot of the advice is violent, deceitful, and cunning.
The lessons are drawn from historical anecdoctes about Kings, Emperors,
Generals, and Con Men. I don't doubt that the laws express the common themes
across history's conquests, conflicts, and revolutions. I do doubt how useful it
is to I, the reader.

Despite not finding the book's "self help" aspect compelling I continued reading
because I enjoyed the historical anecdotes. It's a nice read for entertainment
but not much more. And I did see how I could personally put _some_ of the laws into
practice. Here are my top 5:

- (1) Never outshine the master
- (5) Guard your reputation with your life
- (10) Avoid the unhappy and the unlucky
- (23) Concentrate your forces
- (40) Despise the free lunch
