title: One Year of Spanish on Duolingo 
---

I joined Duolingo in August 2019 with two goals: (a) Be able to understand
native speakers with ease and (b) converse comfortably with native speakers in
casual conversation. After one year I'd like to reflect on my experience, 
how much I've learned, and what I plan to do next.

## Progress
Being able to understand native speakers is still difficult. If I slow
videos down to 0.75 speed I can make out about 80% of what's said. At
full speed I can make out 50% of what's said.

I would say I can converse with native speakers but not **comfortably**. I've
luckily had several opportunities to put my conversational abilities to the test
and have received positive feedback. I'm still slow putting sentences together
and often find myself coming up with the sentence in English first and then translating it
in my head, rather than "thinking in Spanish".

## Practicing with Duolingo
I am nearly finished the entire Spanish tree. **Past Subj.** and **Vocab 4** are my only
unfinished modules.

I was fairly consistent with practicing. I used the app for about 11/12 months
since I started. Each day of practice would be 5-10 lessons.

### What I liked
The "tips" section for each module in checkpoints 1-5 were invaluable. Those
little grammar lessons provided context for what I was learning and greatly
improved my understanding and retention.

### What I didn't like
After checkpoint 5 the "tips" section for the modules vanishes. This was a huge
disappointment and sadly some very important modules like the **Subjunctive**,
**Conditional**, and **Future Tense** lack a tips section. You're essentially
thrown into a lesson introducing a new verb tense without showing you any of
the grammar rules. You could look up the grammar rules online, but that doesn't
make for a good user experience, especially when the grammar lessons _used_ to be
there and simply disappeared without warning.

The modules become quite repetitive after you hit levels 3/4. At that point
you've memorized most of the expressions and when they come up you recall the
answer from memory instead of actually translating it and exercising your
skills.

### Duolingo Conclusion
My conclusion is that duolingo is an excellent launch pad for your Spanish
learning journey but it will **not** event get you close to reading/writing
fluency on its own. It supplies a solid foundation for vocabulary and grammar that
will make more advanced learning material accessible. It lacks any conversational
or serious listening practice (though Duolingo stories is decent for listening).

## Supplementing Duolingo
If you agree with my conclusion about Duolingo then you are most likely seeking
additional learning material. Here is what I found helpful:

- Listen to **all** the [Duolingo Spanish
  podcast](https://podcast.duolingo.com/spanish) episodes if you haven't already.
- Listen to Spanish YouTube channels. I found
  [Easy Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL4AMMMXKxHDu3FqZV6CbQ) and
  [Why Not Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdFcLCIJQ_YMrormG_nU8w) the
  most helpful.
- Find someone to talk to. I practice with a friend of mine who's also learning
  Spanish but ideally you'll want to practice with a native speaker.
  
## If I could go back and restructure my learning.
My practice breakdown was probably 75% Duolingo, 20% listening practice (either
Duolingo Podcasts or YouTube videos), and only 5% speaking practice.

If I could return to the beginning of my Spanish learning journey I would
restructure my learning as 40% Duolingo, 30% listening, and 30% speaking. This
is also what I plan to do moving forward.
