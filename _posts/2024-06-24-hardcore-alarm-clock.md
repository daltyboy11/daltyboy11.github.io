title: A hardcore alarm clock.
---

Do you ever snooze your alarm clock? When your alarm starts ringing at 7 AM do you want to spring out of bed and seize the day, or do you want to return to the comfort of your slumber?

If your alarm just doesn't do it for you, I created a _hardcore alarm clock app_ that provides an extra **oompf**. The motivational quotes and powerful alarm tones were hand picked to inspire you and fuel your drive for success. There's no better way to wake up each day.

Select the time of day, days of the week, and the tone of your alarm.

Add as many alarms as you want to support your personal habits and routines

Your alarm starts ringing at the times you specify, delivering you and uplifting and motivational quote exactly when you need it

And that's it! Simple, yet powerful. If you're a user of the app, and have feedback or need help, please [reach out](mailto:dalton.g.sweeney@gmail.com).
