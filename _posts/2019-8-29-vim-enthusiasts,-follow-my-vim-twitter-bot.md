title: vim enthusiasts, follow my vim twitter bot
---

[@TipsVim](https://twitter.com/TipsVim) is a twitter bot I developed to spread vim knowledge and help increase your text editing productivity!
It tweets a helpful tip or piece of knowledge about text editing in vim, once daily. Tweets are selected from a repository of 100+ tidbits of
knowledge I composed myself!

The bot is deployed on AWS lambda and is triggered by a cloudwatch event.

If you're extra interested in taking your vim editing to the next level, check out [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_and_Vim_Editors) on vi and vim. It's what I used to generate most of @TipsVim's tweets.
