title: vim enthusiasts, check out my vim twitter bot!
---

[@TipsVim](https://twitter.com/TipsVim) is a twitter bot I developed to spread vim knowledge on twitter.

It tweets a helpful tip or piece of knowledge about text editing in vim, once daily. Tweets are selected from a repository of 100+ tidbits of
knowledge I composed myself!

The bot is deployed on AWS lambda and is triggered by a cloudwatch event.

## Vim Resources

If you're extra keen on taking your vim editing to the next level check out [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_and_Vim_Editors) on vi and vim. It's what I used to generate most of @TipsVim's tweets and I occasionally revisit this text when I want to brush up on my skills.

For an authoritative source of knowledge check out [vimhelp](https://vimhelp.org/).

## Source code

You can see the source code for this project on my [github page](https://github.com/daltyboy11/vim-twitter-bot).
