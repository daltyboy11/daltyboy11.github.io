title: Book Review - Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker
---

# Why did I read it?
This is a book about reason, progress, science, and why they are important to
humanity. It felt apt to read it now, during the COVID pandemic, when one
sees nothing but bad news about the state of the world.

# One sentence summary
In vogue among the clerisy, the talking heads, and the pundits on
TV of the day is a pessimism about the state of the world and its direction; however,
the  data on wealth, happiness, alleviation of poverty, and equality paint a very
different picture...

# Review
The popular sentiment of progressophobia in today's influential thought circles
is plain wrong. Progress is a phenomenon
that erases its tracks, and even its champions focus disproportionately on the
progress left to accomplish rather than the progress already made.
Pinker addresses the causes of this progressophobia, shows
us why it lacks merit, and turns our attention to the future and how we might
maintain the perennial march of progress we've enjoyed to this day. 

I failed to find any flaws in Dr. Pinker's argumentation because it's very
difficult to argue against data. His statements about the general increases in
wealth, happiness, equality, human rights, and more are supported by
charts and graphs that show trends in the positive direction. In each
chapter, which focuses on a single metric (e.g. happiness), the author points to
advances in science, human compassion, reason, and other enlightenment
ideals  as probable major causes for the positive trend of the metric. He
also shows that anti-enlightenment ideas like dogma, religious
extremism, fascism, and tribalism are often probable major causes for the
metric's impediment.

This book will succesfully convince any _rational_ person that the human race is
safer, richer, happier, and more democratic today than any other time in
history. As Barack Obama famously said in his keynote address at the 2017
Goalkeepers conference held by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

> If you had to choose one moment in history in which to be born, and you didn't
> know in advance whether you were going to be male or female, which country you
> were going to be from, what your status was, you'd choose right now.

Going further, Dr. Pinker emphasizes that the progress we've achieved thus far
did not come easily but as a result of sustained and concerted effort over decades
and in some cases centuries. In order for the march of progress to continue one must
champion the enlightenment ideals that made it possible and fight against its
current enemies (the rise of nationalism and the election of Donald Trump to the
presidency and his messages of tribalism and anti-intellectualism come to mind).

Overall a cogent case for the championing of enlightenment ideals and
an excellent read for everyone, **especially** for the misanthropes out there.
Rated **5/5**.

## A special note on climate change
I felt that the enlightment approach to climate change outlined in this book is
so important that it should be highlighted in its own section. Pinker champions
an approach to fighting climate changed called _ecomodernism_ or _humanist
environmentalism_.

Firstly, when it comes to pollution there is a tradeoff between environmental
destruction and the benefit humanity receives from the activities that produce
that pollution. Yes, cars, planes, and trains emit carbon emissions. But they
have also connected people across cities, states, and countries, enabling the
flow of people, goods, and services to an incalculable benefit.

Secondly, a country's environmental destruction when plotted against its wealth
follows a sort of [Kuznet's curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve).
As a country begins to accumulate wealth, pollution and environmental
destruction increases. However, as wealth accumulation continues environmental
destruction tapers off and begins to decrease!  The important takeaway is that
as a country gets richer (and more technologically advanced) it pollutes less.

**The environmental Kuznets curve**

What is one of the most important enablers of wealth creation today? Technology.
A reasonable hypothesis is that it's actually the advancement of technology
that's responsible for the environmental kuznets curve. It's not that far fetched
to believe that as technology advances we can more effectively combat climate change.

Thus the ecomodernist approach to climate change is to enable scientific and
technological advancement. Expedite research into nuclear power, create an
economic environment conducive to innovation by removing red tape and
deregulating industries, and fund more fundamental science research.

Note that it is not a blind faith in technology as our savior, but a rational
conclusion that it is our best bet.

This is in stark contrast to another [popular
view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAJsdgTPJpU) on climate change: that we
must stifle economic development and regress to simpler times when we had fewer
polluting technologies.
