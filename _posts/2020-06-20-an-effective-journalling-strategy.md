title: An effective journalling strategy.
---

The benefits of journalling are well known. Many try but few make it
a lasting habit. I'm not going to show you how to stick to consistent
journalling because there are enough resources on that already. I'm going to
show you, someone who's already solved the problem of consistent journalling,
an effective journalling strategy you can use to avoid writing in your journal
but never _reading your journal_.. Journalling is better when you actually
revisit what you write from time to time rather than putting what you write away
on the shelf, collecting dust forever and ever.

## Start with a physical journal
Find a notebook that'll last you several months to a year and journal in there.
I write in a journal almost daily and it took me about six months to fill a 100
page notebook.

## Digitize your physical journal
When you finish the notebook copy your journal, entry by entry, to a digital
medium. I keep it as simple as possible, saving each entry as a YYYY-MM-DD.txt
file.

Pace yourself here. Pause and introspect as you transfer your data from ink and
paper to bits and pixels. It can be an arduous process but it's worth it for
several reasons.

### It forces you to go back and read what you wrote.
I experience a certain joy revisiting the forgotten experiences and emotions of my past
self, reading journal entries and thinking to myself, "oh ya.... that *did*
happen". I often recall additional pieces of the experience that were left out
in the journal.

It's nice to compare how you acted/reacted to something back then with limited
information, with how you would have acted/reacted to the same thing now
given the knowledge you have from the consequences of that action.

If introspection is your thing, this journalling strategy is for you.

### It puts your journal contents in a safe place.
Files on your computer or, better yet, uploaded to the cloud, are a more
permanent place for keeping that precious content. You'll have them forever...
as long as you can manage to not lose your physical journal in the several
months before you start uploading!

## Rinse and repeat
Find a new notebook and repeat the process. Happy journaling!
