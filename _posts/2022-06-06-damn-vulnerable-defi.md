title: Damn Vulnerable DeFi
---

[Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) is an amazing set of problems to practice your
smart contract security skills. I was able to complete 11/12 challenges on my own. I present to you my solutions
with detailed explanations, as well as patched versions of the vulnerable contracts.

Spend at least a few hours hacking on the problems yourself before checking solutions. That's what I did. If
you're still stuck (like I was on the 12th problem), take a look at the list below.
