I'm an ambitious and personable senior software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have internship experience in backend web development at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and mobile (iOS) experience at [Kik Interactive](https://www.kik.com/). I'll be doing more iOS development at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) this fall.

When I'm not writing code I enjoy reading, working out, and salsa dancing.

I particularly enjoy reading (auto)biographies, history, economics, and politics. My favorite contemporary writers are Walter Isaacson, Niall Ferguson, and Thomas Sowell.
