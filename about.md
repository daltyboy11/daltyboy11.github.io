My name is Dalton. I'm an incoming software engineer at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
and graduate of the University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program.
I've interned at [Kik](https://www.kik.com/), Coursera, and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).
I like working on  performant and reliable backend systems.

When I'm not writing code I enjoy reading, lifting weights, and latin dancing
