My name is Dalton. I'm a senior at the University of Waterloo majoring in
Software Engineering. I was previously at [Kik](https://www.kik.com/) (iOS),
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) (Backend), and
[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) (iOS) for internships. I'll be joining
Coursera as a Software Engineer after I graduate in 2020. I'm passionate
about distributed systems and functional programming.

When I'm not writing code I enjoy reading, lifting weights, and salsa dancing.
