Things I've made, mostly for fun.

## Demure Wakeup
A [themed alarm clock app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/demure-wakeup/id6711348495?platform=iphone) for the demure, cutesy, and mindful. Available on iOS.

## Poe NFT
An [NFT collection](https://nft-title-exchange.vercel.app/) inspired by the short stories of one of my favorite authors, Edgar Allan Poe.

This is the first collection to implement _title transfers_ and the _right of reclaim_ for royalties, described in the a16zcrypto blog post _[How NFT royalties work: Designs, challenges, and new ideas](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-nft-royalties-work/)_

## Grindset Alarm
A [themed alarm clock app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grindset-alarm/id6503418886) for iOS to wake up with motivation and crush your daily goals! 

I used DALLE to make the art, and the alarm tones are from various Youtube videos.

## Wordcade
A [web-app of word based minigames](https://wordcade.vercel.app/) to challenge your command of the English language. The games are powered by an LLM to make each gameplay fun and unique.

I submitted this project to the [Anthropic Buildathon](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1806040271672766756). It didn't win but they gave me $100 in API credits as a consolation prize.

## EasyBridge
A free [cross-chain USDC bridging tool](https://www.easybridge.io/) that interfaces directly with Circle's Cross Chain Transfer Protocol. Easily bridge across ETH Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, to ape in to
the next up and coming memecoin (just kidding).
