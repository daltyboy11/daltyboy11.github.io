Things I've made, mostly for fun.

## Grindset Alarm
An [themed alarm clock app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grindset-alarm/id6503418886) for iOS to wake up with motivation and crush your daily goals! 

I used DALLE to make the art, and the alarm tones are from various Youtube videos.

## Wordcade
A [web-app of word based minigames](https://wordcade.vercel.app/) to challenge your command of the English language. The games are powered by an LLM to make each gameplay fun and unique.

I submitted this project to the [Anthropic Buildathon](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1806040271672766756). It didn't win but they gave me $100 in API credits as a consolation prize.

## EasyBridge
A free [cross-chain USDC bridging tool](https://www.easybridge.io/) that interfaces directly with Circle's Cross Chain Transfer Protocol. Easily bridge across ETH Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, to ape in to
the next up and coming memecoin (just kidding).
